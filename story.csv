Speaker,Dialogue
Mr. Stone,"Hey! What site is that?! Get off it!"
You,"It's just a command line..."
Mr. Stone,"I don't think you should be using that."
You,"Whatever."
Mrs. Johnson,"Good morning, class. Today, we'll be delving into the French Revolution. Please take out your textbooks and turn to page 243."
Mrs. Johnson,"What's that you've got there, young man?"
You,"It's just a command line interface. It is how I take notes."
Mrs. Johnson,"I have no idea what that is. Get off of it!"
Student,"Why can't they use the command line? It looks super efficient."
Mrs. Johnson,"I don't know, it's just not... usual. We use paper or word processors here."
Student,"But if it helps them learn better, shouldn't it be okay?"
Mr. Stone,"The issue is, we don't know what it really does. It could be anything."
You,"Actually, it’s just a simple text-based environment for typing commands. It helps me organize my thoughts better than a word processor."
Student,"Mr. Stone, do we even have a class on how this stuff works? It might be useful."
Mr. Stone,"Uh, no, our school doesn't really focus on that kind of technology literacy."
Student,"That kind of sucks. We’re getting behind then, aren't we? Everything runs on computers now. There is a google form that shows the lack of tech literacy."
Mrs. Johnson,"Maybe we are, but it's hard to teach what you don't fully understand yourself."
You,"I could show everyone how it works? It’s actually pretty simple once you get the hang of it."
Mrs. Johnson,"That’s kind of you, but we should stick to the curriculum."
Student,"Maybe that should change. Maybe the curriculum should include learning about modern tech, like coding and using different interfaces."
Mr. Stone,"You might be onto something there. I'll discuss it with the administration."
You,"Can I continue with my notes for now? It really does help me."
Mrs. Johnson,"Okay, go ahead for today. But pass me some information about these command lines for us to look over. We need to learn too, right?"
You,"Sure, I’ll prepare something for the next class!"
Student,"Cool, I’d love to learn that as well. Thanks!"
