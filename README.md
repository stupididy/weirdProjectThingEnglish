### we are using this as the planning document apparently

School is too tech iliterate.

#### Potential ideas:
1. A "hacking game" where you do some puzzles or something and the game builds up to a big final puzzle thing but it's so easy.
2. A game simulating school, but you know how to use technology, and the school dosent like it.


#### Plans for the future:
1. Make a "player" model in blender at home
2. Throw stuff into godot
3. implement controls
4. implement a computer
5. implement other human models
6. godot so gdscript
7. dialog with voice acting
8. 1st and 3rd person camera system
9. Make Models:
    - Desk
    - Shelf
    - Chair
    - Clock
    - Whiteboard
    - Pencil
    - Computer
    - Binder
    - 

#### Q&A evidence:
1. do you know a programming langauge?
2. do you know what an operating system is?
3. are you comfortable with a command line?
4. have you ever run a server ON YOUR OWN HARDWARE?\
(if a person does not understand the question, the answer is no)



#### Research:
