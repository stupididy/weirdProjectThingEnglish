### we are using this as the planning document apparently

School is too tech iliterate.

#### Potential ideas:
1. A "hacking game" where you do some puzzles or something and the game builds up to a big final puzzle thing but it's so easy.
2. A game simulating school, but you know how to use technology, and the school dosent like it.


#### Plans for the future:
1. Make a "player" model in blender at home
2. Throw stuff into godot
3. implement controls
4. implement computer
